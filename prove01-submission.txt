After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

https://github.com/JusWes16/team.git

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

I think all of the elements are working as they should. There are 3 redirects which all work. ‘/’ and ‘/users’ for the 2 different pages and then ‘/create-user’ entering in a new user and displaying it to the console. 

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

As far as what was required everything works. I was not able to get the new username to be added to the list of users on the ‘/users’ page. 

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

I think just creating a server that could be accessed through a url was the coolest thing. As of right now it’s only local but I just think its really cool that we were able to do that with only Node.js. 

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

I thought it was a great assignment and I don’t think I would change or add anything. 

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

4-Meets requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

Everything works as it should. The only thing that I couldn’t get to work was adding the new username to the list of users. I tried pushing it to an array that was used to build the list but I couldn’t get that to work.
